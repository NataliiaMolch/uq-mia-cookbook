### 1. Structure Size as Confounder in Uncertainty Based Segmentation Quality Prediction

**Authors:** Kai Geißler, Jochen G. Hirsch, Stefan Heldmann, Hans Meine

**Conference:** MIDL (Volume 250)

**Abstract:** Various uncertainty estimation methods have been proposed for deep learning-based image segmentation models. An uncertainty measure is treated useful if it can be used to accurately predict segmentation quality. Therefore, structure-wise uncertainty measures are frequently correlated with measures like the Dice score. However, it is known that the Dice score highly depends on the size of the structure of interest. It is less well-known that popular structure-wise uncertainty measures also correl...

**Authors:** Nima Fathi, Amar Kumar, Brennan Nichyporuk, Mohammad Havaei, Tal Arbel

**Conference:** MIDL (Volume 250)

**Abstract:** Deep learning classifiers are prone to latching onto dominant confounders present in a dataset rather than on the causal markers associated with the target class, leading to poor generalization and biased predictions. Although explainability via counterfactual image generation has been successful at exposing the problem, bias mitigation strategies that permit accurate explainability in the presence of dominant and diverse artifacts remain unsolved. In this work, we propose the DeCoDEx framework ...

### 15. Resolution and Field of View Invariant Generative Modelling with Latent Diffusion Models

**Authors:** Ashay Patel, Mark S Graham, Vicky Goh, Sebastien Ourselin, M. Jorge Cardoso

**Conference:** MIDL (Volume 250)

**Abstract:** Large dataset requirements for deep learning methods can pose a challenge in the medical field, where datasets tend to be relatively small. Synthetic data can provide a suitable solution to this problem, when complemented with real data. However current generative methods normally require all data to be of the same resolution and, ideally, aligned to an atlas. This not only creates more stringent restrictions on the training data but also limits what data can be used for inference. To overcome t...

### 17. There Are No Shortcuts to Anywhere Worth Going: Identifying Shortcuts in Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Analysis

**Authors:** Christopher Boland, Keith A Goatman, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris, Sonia Dahdouh

**Conference:** MIDL (Volume 250)

**Abstract:** Many studies have reported human-level accuracy (or better) for AI-powered algorithms performing a specific clinical task, such as detecting pathology. However, these results often fail to generalize to other scanners or populations. Several mechanisms have been identified that confound generalization. One such is shortcut learning, where a network erroneously learns to depend on a fragile spurious feature, such as a text label added to the image, rather than scrutinizing the genuinely useful re...
