However, previous methods generally lack effective supervision in uncertainty estimation, leading to low interpretability and robustness of the predictions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to guide the learning of uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce three principles about the relationships between the uncertainty and the ...

### 5. UNSURF: Uncertainty Quantification for Cortical Surface Reconstruction of Clinical Brain MRIs

**Authors:** Gopinath, Karthik; Mehta, Raghav; Glocker, Ben; Iglesias, Juan Eugenio

**Abstract:** We propose a novel uncertainty measure for cortical surface reconstruction (UNSURF) of clinical brain MRI scans of any orientation, resolution, and contrast. It relies on the discrepancy between predicted voxel-wise signed distance functions (SDFs) and the actual SDFs of the fitted surfaces. Our experiments on real clinical scans show that traditional uncertainty measures, such as Monte Carlo variance, are not suitable for modeling the uncertainty of surface placement. Our results demonstrate th...

**Authors:** Yang, Shuhua; Cai, Tongan; Ni, Haomiao; Ma, Wenchao; Xue, Yuan; Wong, Kelvin; Volpi, John; Wang, James Z.; Huang, Sharon X.; Wong, Stephen T. C.

**Abstract:** Stroke diagnosis in emergency rooms (ERs) is challenging due to limited access to MRI scans and a shortage of neurologists. Although AI-assisted triage has shown promise, existing methods typically use MRI-derived training labels, which may not align with stroke patterns in patient multimedia data. To address this mismatch, we propose an Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Stroke TrIage Network (AUSTIN) that leverages inconsistencies between clinician triage decisions and MRI-derived labels to enhance AI...

### 12. E-BayesSAM: Efficient Bayesian Adaptation of SAM with Self-Optimizing KAN-Based Interpretation for Uncertainty-Aware Ultrasonic Segmentation

**Authors:** Huang, Bin; Liu, Zhong; Wen, Huiying; Huang, Bingsheng; Chen, Xin; Li, Shuo

**Abstract:** Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM’s massive parameters; (3) SAM’s black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Ba...

**Authors:** Oh, Ji-Hun; Falahkheirkhah, Kianoush; Bhargava, Rohit

**Abstract:** Label-free chemical imaging holds significant promise for improving digital pathology workflows, but data acquisition speed remains a limiting factor. To address this gap, we propose an adaptive strategy—initially scan the low information (LI) content of the entire tissue quickly, identify regions with high aleatoric uncertainty (AU), and selectively re-image them at better quality to capture higher information (HI) details. The primary challenge lies in distinguishing between high-AU regions mi...

### 29. Temporal Model-Based Federated Active Medical Image Classification

**Authors:** Yan, Yunlu; Feng, Chun-Mei; Li, Yuexiang; Xie, Jinheng; Chen, Jun; Elhoseiny, Mohamed; Hu, Ming; Wu, Kaishun; Zhu, Lei

**Abstract:** Traditional federated learning relies on fully labeled datasets in each medical institution, which is impractical in real-world clinical scenarios. Federated Active Learning (FAL) addresses this by selecting a few informative samples for labeling, but it faces challenges such as domain shift across institutions. Besides, existing FAL methods rely on single-round model knowledge to estimate prediction-level uncertainty, ignoring uncertainty from features and model evolution during training. In th...

**Authors:** Chen, Zige; Qin, Haonan; Wang, Wei; Zhou, Zhongkai; Zhao, Chen; Fang, Yuqi; Shan, Caifeng

**Abstract:** Asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) is an early stage of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. Recent studies have investigated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for ANI analysis, but most of them rely on single modality, neglecting to utilize complementary information derived from multiple MRI modalties.
For a few multimodal MRI fusion studies, they usually suffer from ``modality laziness’’, where dominant modalities suppress weaker ones due to misalignment and scale disparities, limi...

### 31. Domain Generalization for Pulmonary Nodule Detection via Distributionally-Regularized Mamba

**Authors:** Lan, Tianzhong; Chen, Nan; Yi, Zhang; Xu, Xiuyuan; Zhu, Min

**Abstract:** Extending deep learning models to out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) data remains a persistent challenge, especially in domains like medical imaging with restricted data availability and limited data sharing. This challenge is particularly evident in pulmonary nodule detection, as the model struggles to distinguish nodules from the surrounding normal tissues across different data distributions. To address this issue, we propose a Distributionally Regularized Mamba Network (DRMNet). Inspired by Mamba, ...

**Authors:** Thrun, Solveig; Hansen, Stine; Sun, Zijun; Blum, Nele; Salahuddin, Suaiba A.; Wickstrøm, Kristoffer; Wetzer, Elisabeth; Jenssen, Robert; Stille, Maik; Kampffmeyer, Michael

**Abstract:** Regular mammography screening is essential for early breast cancer detection and deep learning-based risk prediction methods have sparked interest to adjust screening intervals for high-risk groups. While early methods focused only on current mammograms, recent approaches leverage the temporal aspect of screenings to track breast tissue changes over time, requiring spatial alignment across different time points. Two main strategies for this have emerged: explicit feature alignment through deform...

### 62. Difficulty Estimation for Image-Specific Medical Image Segmentation Quality Control

**Authors:** Fournel, Joris; Bartoli, Axel; Marchi, Baptiste; Maurin, Arnaud; Bigdeli, Siavash Arjomand; Jacquier, Alexis; Feragen, Aasa

**Abstract:** In clinical decisions, trusting erroneous information can be as harmful as discarding crucial data. 
Without accurate quality assessment of medical image segmentation, both can occur. In current segmentation quality control, any segmentation with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) above a set threshold would be considered “good enough”, while segmentations below the threshold would be discarded. However, those global thresholds ignore input-specific factors, increasing the risk of accepting ina...

### 127. Contour Makes It Stronger: Cross-Domain Cephalometric Landmark Detection Based on Contour Priors

**Authors:** Liang, Xinyue; Chen, Runnan; Wei, Guangshun; Zhuang, Shaojie; Zhou, Yuanfeng

**Abstract:** The detection of cephalometric landmarks is crucial for orthodontic diagnosis. Current methods mainly focus on utilizing contextual information to detect landmarks while overlooking the challenges posed by domain gaps. In this paper, we propose a contour-guided framework that leverages cranial soft/hard tissue contours as domain-invariant anatomical priors. The method introduces a joint attention module to fuse the topological features corresponding to the contours with contextual features, ensu...

### 132. OsteoOpt: A Bayesian Optimization Framework for Enhancing Bone Union Likelihood in Mandibular Reconstruction Surgery

**Authors:** Aftabi, Hamidreza; Lloyd, John E.; Ding, Amanda; Sagl, Benedikt; Prisman, Eitan; Hodgson, Antony; Fels, Sidney

**Abstract:** Mandibular reconstruction is crucial after oral tumor resection, yet current methods rely on premorbid geometric approximations and struggle with achieving reliable donor-native bone union. We propose a Bayesian optimization framework that enhances predicted bone union likelihood and facilitates computer-aided intervention by systematically varying key surgical parameters—resection plane orientation, donor bone positioning, and graft length—across three mandibular regions. Reconstruction perform...

### 133. Active Source-Free Cross-Domain and Cross-Modality Adaptation for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation by Image Sensitivity and Organ Heterogeneity Sampling

**Authors:** Yang, Jin; Yu, Xiaobing; Qiu, Peijie; Marcus, Daniel; Sotiras, Aristeidis

**Abstract:** Deep learning (DL) methods have achieved great success in medical image segmentation, but they are challenged to demonstrate robust performance across different datasets due to domain and modality gaps. The Source-Free Domain Adaptation techniques adapt DL models to generalize across domains without access to source data, and active learning is implemented to actively query informative target samples to fine-tune models, thus improving their generalization. However, only a few Active Source-Free...

### 134. Spatiotemporal-Sensitive Network for Microvascular Obstruction Segmentation from Cine Cardiac Magnetic Resonance

**Authors:** Yu, Yang; Kok, Christopher; Wang, Jiahao; Cheng, Jun; Leng, Shuang; Tan, Ru San; Zhong, Liang; Yang, Xulei

**Abstract:** Accurate diagnosis of microvascular obstruction (MVO) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients typically relies on Cine Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) (video sequences) and Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) CMR (images). However, LGE imaging is contraindicated in approximately 20% of AMI patients with chronic kidney disease, underscoring the need for Cine CMR as a standalone diagnostic alternative. Although recent advancements in deep learning have improved video data processing, ...

### 136. ISAC: Redefining the Vascular Segmentation Paradigm through Mask Completion for Cross-Domain Generalization

**Authors:** Zhao, Tianyu; Huang, Zihang; Jiang, Xixi; Zhang, Liang; Ding, Xiaohuan; Yang, Xin

**Abstract:** Accurate vessel segmentation is critical for diagnosis. However, the annotation of vascular images cost a lot, and due to their diverse modalities and complex foreground structures, it is hard for learning-based methods to reduce annotation cost by training models of high domain generalization (DG) on partial modalities. To address this, we propose the Image-Sparse Annotation Completion (ISAC) segmentation model, which reformulates vascular segmentation as a mask completion task based on sparse-...

### 137. Edge-semantic Synergy Fusion and Adaptive Noise-aware for Weakly Supervised Pathological Tissue Segmentation

**Authors:** Zhang, Hualong; Feng, Siyang; Huan, Zihan; Wang, Huadeng; Liu, Zhenbing; Lan, Rushi; Pan, Xipeng

**Abstract:** Existing studies on weakly supervised pathological tissue segmentation predominantly rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to generate pixel-level pseudo-masks from image-level labels. However, CAMs tend to emphasize only the most discriminative regions, resulting in boundary noise that undermines the quality of pseudo-masks and degrades segmentation performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly supervised pathological tissue segmentation framework: Edge-semantic Synergy Fus...

### 139. Enforcing Geometric Constraints of Surface Normal and Pose for Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation on Laparoscopic Images

**Authors:** Li, Wenda; Hayashi, Yuichiro; Oda, Masahiro; Kitasaka, Takayuki; Misawa, Kazunari; Mori, Kensaku

**Abstract:** Depth information is essential for 3D reconstruction in surgical scenes. Depth-pose-based self-supervised monocular depth estimation has advanced significantly but faces two challenges in laparoscopic scenes, leading to unreliable pixel matching during training. This also results in depth maps failing to preserve geometric structure when back-projected into 3D space. Second, limited movement space causes laparoscopic motion to involve pure complex rotations. It further complicates the relative p...
