**Authors:** Chen, Aobo; Li, Yangyi; Qian, Wei; Morse, Kathryn; Miao, Chenglin; Huai, Mengdi

**Abstract:** Medical image classification is an important task in many different medical applications. The past years have witnessed the success of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in medical image classification. However, traditional softmax outputs produced by DNNs fail to estimate uncertainty in medical image predictions. Contrasting with conventional uncertainty estimation approaches, conformal prediction (CP) stands out as a model-agnostic and distribution-free methodology that constructs statistically rigor...

### 3. Laplacian Segmentation Networks Improve Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification

**Authors:** Zepf, Kilian; Wanna, Selma; Miani, Marco; Moore, Juston; Frellsen, Jes; Hauberg, SÃ¸ren; Warburg, Frederik; Feragen, Aasa

**Abstract:** Image segmentation relies heavily on neural networks which are known to be overconfident, especially when making predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) images. This is a common scenario in the medical domain due to variations in equipment, acquisition sites, or image corruptions. This work addresses the challenge of OOD detection by proposing Laplacian Segmentation Networks (LSN): methods which jointly model epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty for OOD detection. In doing so, we ...

### 9. Heteroscedastic Uncertainty Estimation Framework for Unsupervised Registration

**Authors:** Zhang, Xiaoran; Pak, Daniel H.; Ahn, Shawn S.; Li, Xiaoxiao; You, Chenyu; Staib, Lawrence H.; Sinusas, Albert J.; Wong, Alex; Duncan, James S.

**Abstract:** Deep learning methods for unsupervised registration often rely on objectives that assume a uniform noise level across the spatial domain (e.g. mean-squared error loss), but noise distributions are often heteroscedastic and input-dependent in real-world medical images. Thus, this assumption often leads to degradation in registration performance, mainly due to the undesired influence of noise-induced outliers. To mitigate this, we propose a framework for heteroscedastic image uncertainty estimatio...

### 10. Reliable Multi-View Learning with Conformal Prediction for Aortic Stenosis Classification in Echocardiography

**Authors:** Gu, Ang Nan; Tsang, Michael; Vaseli, Hooman; Tsang, Teresa; Abolmaesumi, Purang

**Abstract:** The fundamental problem with ultrasound-guided diagnosis is that the acquired images are often 2-D cross-sections of a 3-D anatomy, potentially missing important anatomical details. This limitation leads to challenges in ultrasound echocardiography, such as poor visualization of heart valves or foreshortening of ventricles. Clinicians must interpret these images with inherent uncertainty, a nuance absent in machine learningâs one-hot labels. We propose Re-Training for Uncertainty (RT4U), a data-...

### 12. Revisiting Deep Ensemble Uncertainty for Enhanced Medical Anomaly Detection

**Authors:** Gu, Yi; Lin, Yi; Cheng, Kwang-Ting; Chen, Hao

**Abstract:** Medical anomaly detection (AD) is crucial in pathological identification and localization. Current methods typically rely on uncertainty estimation in deep ensembles to detect anomalies, assuming that ensemble learners should agree on normal samples while exhibiting disagreement on unseen anomalies in the output space. However, these methods may suffer from inadequate disagreement on anomalies or diminished agreement on normal samples. To tackle these issues, we propose D2UE, a Diversified Dual-...

### 15. Deep Model Reference: Simple yet Effective Confidence Estimation for Image Classification

**Authors:** Zheng, Yuanhang; Qiu, Yiqiao; Che, Haoxuan; Chen, Hao; Zheng, Wei-Shi; Wang, Ruixuan

**Abstract:** Effective confidence estimation is desired for image classifi-
cation tasks like clinical diagnosis based on medical imaging. However, it is well known that modern neural networks often show over-confidence in their predictions. Deep Ensemble (DE) is one of the state-of-the-art methods to estimate reliable confidence. In this work, we observed that DE sometimes harms the confidence estimation due to relatively lower confidence output for correctly classified samples. Motivated by the observation...

**Authors:** Fischer, Paul; Willms, Hannah; Schneider, Moritz; Thorwarth, Daniela; Muehlebach, Michael; Baumgartner, Christian F.

**Abstract:** Cancer remains a leading cause of death, highlighting the importance of effective radiotherapy (RT). Magnetic resonance-guided linear accelerators (MR-Linacs) enable imaging during RT, allowing for inter-fraction, and perhaps even intra-fraction, adjustments of treatment plans. However, achieving this requires fast and accurate dose calculations. While Monte Carlo simulations offer accuracy, they are computationally intensive. Deep learning frameworks show promise, yet lack uncertainty quantific...

**Authors:** Das, Abhijit; Gorade, Vandan; Kumar, Komal; Chakraborty, Snehashis; Mahapatra, Dwarikanath; Roy, Sudipta

**Abstract:** In recent years pseudo label (PL) based semi-supervised (SS) methods have been proposed for disease localization in medical images for tasks with limited labeled data. However these models are not curated for chest x-rays containing anomalies of different shapes and sizes. As a result, existing methods suffer from biased attentiveness towards minor class and PL inconsistency. Soft labeling based methods filters out PLs with higher uncertainty but leads to loss of fine-grained features of minor a...

### 24. Confidence Matters: Enhancing Medical Image Classification Through Uncertainty-Driven Contrastive Self-Distillation

**Authors:** Sharma, Saurabh; Kumar, Atul; Chandra, Joydeep

**Abstract:** The scarcity of data in medical image classification using deep learning often leads to overfitting the training data. Research indicates that self-distillation techniques, particularly those employing mean teacher ensembling, can alleviate this issue. However, directly transferring knowledge distillation (KD) from computer vision to medical image classification yields subpar results due to higher intra-class variance and class imbalance in medical images. This can cause supervised and contrasti...

Integrating biophysics-informed regularisation is one effective way to change this situation, as it provides an prior regularisation for automated end-to-end learning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that designs brain tumour growth Part...

**Authors:** Dang, Trung; Nguyen, Huy Hoang; Tiulpin, Aleksei

**Abstract:** One of the primary challenges in brain tumor segmentation arises from the uncertainty of voxels close to tumor boundaries. However, the conventional process of generating ground truth segmentation masks fails to treat such uncertainties properly. Those ``hard labelsââ with 0s and 1s conceptually influenced the majority of prior studies on brain image segmentation. As a result, tumor segmentation is often solved through voxel classification. In this work, we instead view this problem as a voxel-l...

**Abstract:** Federated learning is one popular paradigm to train a joint model in a distributed, privacy-preserving environment. But partial annotations pose an obstacle meaning that categories of labels are heterogeneous over clients. We propose to learn a joint backbone in a federated manner, while each site receives its own multi-label segmentation head. By using Bayesian techniques we observe that the different segmentation heads although only trained on the individual clientâs labels also learn informat...

### 29. Geometric Transformation Uncertainty for Improving 3D Fetal Brain Pose Prediction from Freehand 2D Ultrasound Videos

**Authors:** Ramesh, Jayroop; Dinsdale, Nicola; Yeung, Pak-Hei; Namburete, Ana I. L.

**Abstract:** Accurately localizing two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound (US) fetal brain images in the 3D brain, using minimal computational resources, is an important task for automated US analysis of fetal growth and development. We propose an uncertainty-aware deep learning model for automated 3D plane localization in 2D fetal brain images. Specifically, a multi-head network is trained to jointly regress 3D plane pose from 2D images in terms of different geometric transformations. The model explicitly learns t...

**Abstract:** Accurate segmentation of echocardiograph images is essential for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Recent advances in deep learning have opened a possibility for automated cardiac image segmentation. However, the data-driven echocardiography segmentation schemes suffer from domain shift problems, since the ultrasonic image characteristics are largely affected by measurement conditions determined by device and probe specification. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a domain gen...

### 33. Average Calibration Error: A Differentiable Loss for Improved Reliability in Image Segmentation

**Authors:** Barfoot, Theodore; Garcia Peraza Herrera, Luis C.; Glocker, Ben; Vercauteren, Tom

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation often produce overconfident results misaligned with empirical observations. Such miscalibration, challenges their clinical translation. We propose to use marginal L1 average calibration error (mL1-ACE) as a novel auxiliary loss function to improve pixel-wise calibration without compromising segmentation quality. We show that this loss, despite using hard binning, is directly differentiable, bypassing the need for approximate but differentiable ...

Deep learning (DL) models typically exhibit a preference for learning from easy data and simple patterns before they learn from complex ones. However, existing AL methods often employ a fixed query strategy for sample selection, which may cause the model to focus too closely on challenging-to-classify data. The result is a deceleration of the convergence of DL models and an increase in the amount of la...

Such sequences rely on echo-planar imaging (EPI) to achieve reasonable scan duration. However, EPI is vulnerable to off-resonance effects, leading to tissue susceptibility and eddy-current induced distortions. The latter is particularly problematic because it causes misalignment between volumes, disrupting downstream modelling and analysis. The es...

### 62. Latent Spaces Enable Transformer-Based Dose Prediction in Complex Radiotherapy Plans

**Authors:** Wang, Edward; Au, Ryan; Lang, Pencilla; Mattonen, Sarah A.

**Abstract:** Evidence is accumulating in favour of using stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) to treat multiple cancer lesions in the lung. Multi-lesion lung SABR plans are complex and require significant resources to create. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage latent transformer framework (LDFormer) for dose prediction of lung SABR plans with varying numbers of lesions. In the first stage, patient anatomical information and the dose distribution are encoded into a latent space. In the secon...

### 94. Progressively Correcting Soft Labels via Teacher Team for Knowledge Distillation in Medical Image Segmentation

**Authors:** Wang, Yaqi; Cao, Peng; Hou, Qingshan; Lan, Linqi; Yang, Jinzhu; Liu, Xiaoli; Zaiane, Osmar R.

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art knowledge distillation (KD) methods aim to capture the underlying information within the teacher and explore effective strategies for knowledge transfer.
However, due to challenges such as blurriness, noise, and low contrast inherent in medical images, the teacherâs predictions (soft labels) may also include false information, thus potentially misguiding the studentâs learning process.
Addressing this, we pioneer a novel correction-based KD approach (PLC-KD) and introduce two as...
